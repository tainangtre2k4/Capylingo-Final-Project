How clear is the image that springs to mind?</strong></p><p>Most people can readily conjure images inside their head—known as their mind's eye. But this year, scientists have described a condition, aphantasia, in which some people are unable to visualize mental images.</p><p>Niel Kenmuir, from Lancaster, has always had a blind mind's eye. He knew he was different even in childhood. \"My stepfather, when I couldn't sleep, told me to count sheep, and he explained what he meant. I tried to do it, and I couldn't,\" he says. \"I couldn't see any sheep jumping over fences; there was nothing to count.\"</p><p>Our memories are often tied up in images, like recalling a wedding or the first day at school. As a result, Niel admits some aspects of his memory are \"terrible,\" but he is very good at remembering facts. Like others with aphantasia, he struggles to recognize faces. Yet, he does not see aphantasia as a disability, but simply a different way of experiencing life.</p><p align=\"center\" style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Mind's Eye Blind</p><p>Ironically, Niel now works in a bookshop, although he largely sticks to the non-fiction aisles. His condition raises the question of what is going on inside his picture-less mind. When asked what happens when he tries to picture his fiancée, Niel explains, \"This is the hardest thing to describe—what happens in my head when I think about things. When I think about my fiancée, there is no image, but I am definitely thinking about her. I know today she has her hair up at the back; she's brunette. But I'm not describing an image I am looking at; I'm remembering features about her. That's the strangest thing, and maybe that is a source of some regret.\"</p><p>The response from his mates is often a sympathetic: \"You're weird.\" While Niel is relaxed about his inability to picture things, it can be a source of distress for others. One person who took part in a study into aphantasia said he had started to feel \"isolated\" and \"alone\" after discovering that other people could see images in their heads. Being unable to reminisce about his mother years after her death led to him being \"extremely distraught.\"</p><p align=\"center\" style=\"font-weight: bold;\">The Super-Visualiser</p><p>At the other end of the spectrum is children's book illustrator Lauren Beard, whose work on the Fairytale Hairdresser series will be familiar to many six-year-olds. Her career relies on the vivid images that leap into her mind's eye when she reads text from her author. In her box-room studio in Manchester, she was working on a dramatic scene for the next book, where the text describes a baby perilously climbing onto a chandelier.</p><p>\"Straightaway, I can visualize this grand glass chandelier in some sort of French ballroom, and the little baby just swinging off it with really heavy thick curtains,\" she says. \"I think I have a strong imagination, so I can create the world and then keep adding to it so it gets sort of bigger and bigger in my mind, and the characters too, they sort of evolve. I couldn't really imagine what it's like to not imagine; I think it must be a bit of a shame really.\"</p><p>Not many people have mental imagery as vibrant as Lauren or as blank as Niel. They are the two extremes of visualization. Adam Zeman, a professor of cognitive and behavioural neurology, wants to compare the lives and experiences of people with aphantasia and its polar opposite, hyperphantasia. His team, based at the University of Exeter, coined the term aphantasia in a study published in the journal Cortex this year.</p><p>Prof Zeman tells the BBC, \"People who have contacted us say they are really delighted that this has been recognized and given a name, because they have been trying to explain to people for years that there is this oddity that they find hard to convey to others.\" How we imagine is clearly very subjective—one person's vivid scene could be another's grainy picture. But Prof Zeman is certain that aphantasia is real. People often report being able to dream in pictures, and there have been reported cases of people losing the ability to think in images after a brain injury.</p><p>He is adamant that aphantasia is \"not a disorder\" and says it may affect up to one in 50 people. But he adds, \"I think it makes quite an important difference to their experience of life because many of us spend our lives with imagery hovering somewhere in the mind's eye, which we inspect from time to time. It's a variability of human experience.\"</p></div>"

But some in the business world suggest otherwise. Beyond the morally reprehensible side of criminals' work, some business gurus say organised crime syndicates, computer hackers, pirates and others operating outside the law could teach legitimate corporations a thing or two about how to hustle and respond to rapid change.</p><p><br><strong>(B)</strong> Far from encouraging illegality, these gurus argue that – in the same way big corporations sometimes emulate start-ups – business leaders could learn from the underworld about flexibility, innovation and the ability to pivot quickly. “There is a nimbleness to criminal organisations that legacy corporations [with large, complex layers of management] don’t have,” said Marc Goodman, head of the Future Crimes Institute and global cyber-crime advisor. While traditional businesses focus on rules they have to follow, criminals look to circumvent them. “For criminals, the sky is the limit and that creates the opportunity to think much, much bigger.”</p><p><br><strong>(C)</strong> Joaquin Guzman, the head of the Mexican Sinaloa drug cartel, for instance, slipped out of his prison cell through a tiny hole in his shower that led to a mile-long tunnel fitted with lights and ventilation. Making a break for it required creative thinking, long-term planning and perseverance – essential skills similar to those needed to achieve success in big business.</p><p><br><strong>(D)</strong> While Devin Liddell, who heads brand strategy for Seattle-based design consultancy, Teague, condemns the violence and other illegal activities he became curious as to how criminal groups endure. Some cartels stay in business despite multiple efforts by law enforcement on both sides of the US border and millions of dollars from international agencies to shut them down. Liddell genuinely believes there’s a lesson in longevity here. One strategy he underlined was how the bad guys respond to change. In order to bypass the border between Mexico and the US, for example, the Sinaloa cartel went to great lengths. It built a vast underground tunnel, hired family members as border agents and even used a catapult to circumvent a high-tech fence.</p><p><br><strong>(E)</strong> By contrast, many legitimate businesses fail because they hesitate to adapt quickly to changing market winds. One high-profile example is movie and game rental company Blockbuster, which didn’t keep up with the market and lost business to mail order video rentals and streaming technologies. The brand has all but faded from view. Liddell argues the difference between the two groups is that criminal organisations often have improvisation encoded into their daily behaviour, while larger companies think of innovation as a set process. “This is a leadership challenge,” said Liddell. “How well companies innovate and organise is a reflection of leadership.”</p><p><br><strong>Left-field thinking</strong></p><p><br><strong>(F)</strong> Cash-strapped start-ups also use unorthodox strategies to problem solve and build their businesses up from scratch. This creativity and innovation is often borne out of necessity, such as tight budgets. Both criminals and start-up founders “question authority, act outside the system and see new and clever ways of doing things,” said Goodman. “Either they become Elon Musk or El Chapo.” And, some entrepreneurs aren’t even afraid to operate in legal grey areas in their effort to disrupt the marketplace. The co-founders of music streaming service Napster, for example, knowingly broke music copyright rules with their first online file sharing service, but their technology paved the way for legal innovation as regulators caught up.</p><p><br><strong>(G)</strong> Goodman and others believe thinking hard about problem solving before worrying about restrictions could prevent established companies falling victim to rivals less constrained by tradition. In their book The Misfit Economy, Alexa Clay and Kyra Maya Phillips examine how individuals can apply that mindset to become more innovative and entrepreneurial within corporate structures. They studied not just violent criminals like Somali pirates, but others who break the rules in order to find creative solutions to their business problems, such as people living in the slums of Mumbai or computer hackers. They picked out five common traits among this group: the ability to hustle, pivot, provoke, hack and copycat.</p><p><br><strong>(H)</strong> Clay gives a Saudi entrepreneur named Walid Abdul-Wahab as a prime example. Abdul-Wahab worked with Amish farmers to bring camel milk to American consumers even before US regulators approved it. Through perseverance, he eventually found a network of Amish camel milk farmers and started selling the product via social media. Now his company, Desert Farms, sells to giant mainstream retailers like Whole Foods Market. Those on the fringe don’t always have the option of traditional, corporate jobs and that forces them to think more creatively about how to make a living, Clay said. They must develop grit and resilience in order to last outside the cushy confines of cubicle life. “In many cases scarcity is the mother of invention,” Clay said.</p></div>"

Speaking earlier, Culture Secretary John Whittingdale rejected suggestions that he wanted to dismantle the BBC.</p><p style=\"font-weight:bold;\">'Champion supporters'</p><p>Iannucci co-wrote <em>\"I'm Alan Partridge\"</em>, wrote the movie <em>\"In the Loop\"</em> and created and wrote the hit <em>\"HBO\"</em> and <em>\"Sky Atlantic show Veep\"</em>. He delivered the 40th annual MacTaggart Lecture, which has previously been given by Oscar winner Kevin Spacey, former BBC director general Greg Dyke, Jeremy Paxman and Rupert Murdoch. Iannucci said: \"Faced with a global audience, British television needs its champion supporters.\"</p><p>He continued his praise for British programming by saying the global success of American TV shows had come about because they were emulating British television. \"The best US shows are modelling themselves on what used to make British TV so world-beating,\" he said. \"US prime-time schedules are now littered with those quirky formats from the UK - the <em>\"Who Do You Think You Are\"</em>'s and the variants on <em>\"Strictly Come Dancing\"</em> - as well as the single-camera non-audience sitcom, which we brought into the mainstream first. We have changed international viewing for the better.\"</p><p>With the renewal of the BBC's royal charter approaching, Iannucci also praised the corporation. He said: \"If public service broadcasting - one of the best things we've ever done creatively as a country - if it was a car industry, our ministers would be out championing it overseas, trying to win contracts, boasting of the British jobs that would bring.\" In July, the government issued a green paper setting out issues that will be explored during negotiations over the future of the BBC, including the broadcaster's size, its funding and governance.</p><p>Primarily Mr Whittingdale wanted to appoint a panel of five people, but finally he invited two more people to advise on the channer renewal, namely former Channel 4 boss Dawn Airey and journalism professor Stewart Purvis, a former editor-in-chief of ITN. Iannucci bemoaned the lack of \"creatives\" involved in the discussions. </p><p>\"When the media, communications and information industries make up nearly 8% our GDP, larger than the car and oil and gas industries put together, we need to be heard, as those industries are heard. But when I see the panel of experts who've been asked by the culture secretary to take a root and branch look at the BBC, I don't see anyone who is a part of that cast and crew list. I see executives, media owners, industry gurus, all talented people - but not a single person who's made a classic and enduring television show.\"</p><p style=\"font-weight:bold;\">'Don't be modest'</p><p>Iannucci suggested one way of easing the strain on the licence fee was \"by pushing ourselves more commercially abroad\". </p><p>\"Use the BBC's name, one of the most recognised brands in the world,\" he said. \"And use the reputation of British television across all networks, to capitalise financially oversees. Be more aggressive in selling our shows, through advertising, through proper international subscription channels, freeing up BBC Worldwide to be fully commercial, whatever it takes.</p><p>\"Frankly, don't be icky and modest about making money, let's monetise the bezeesus Mary and Joseph out of our programmes abroad so that money can come back, take some pressure off the licence fee at home and be invested in even more ambitious quality shows, that can only add to our value.\"</p><p>Mr Whittingdale, who was interviewed by ITV News' Alastair Stewart at the festival, said he wanted an open debate about whether the corporation should do everything it has done in the past. He said he had a slight sense that people who rushed to defend the BBC were \"trying to have an argument that's never been started\".</p><p>\"Whatever my view is, I don't determine what programmes the BBC should show,\" he added. \"That's the job of the BBC.\" Mr Whittingdale said any speculation that the Conservative Party had always wanted to change the BBC due to issues such as its editorial line was \"absolute nonsense\".</p></div>"

What is it that draws us to these creatures?</p><p>  \"This inhuman place makes human monsters,\" wrote Stephen King in his novel The Shining. Many academics agree that monsters lurk in the deepest recesses, they prowl through our ancestral minds appearing in the half-light, under the bed - or at the bottom of the sea.</p><p>  \"They don't really exist, but they play a huge role in our mindscapes, in our dreams, stories, nightmares, myths and so on,\" says Matthias Classen, assistant professor of literature and media at Aarhus University in Denmark, who studies monsters in literature. \"Monsters say something about human psychology, not the world.\"</p><p> One Norse legend talks of the Kraken, a deep sea creature that was the curse of fishermen. If sailors found a place with many fish, most likely it was the monster that was driving them to the surface. If it saw the ship it would pluck the hapless sailors from the boat and drag them to a watery grave.</p><p>  This terrifying legend occupied the mind and pen of the poet Alfred Lord Tennyson too. In his short 1830 poem The Kraken he wrote: \"Below the thunders of the upper deep, / Far far beneath in the abysmal sea, / His ancient, dreamless, uninvaded sleep / The Kraken sleepeth.\"</p><p>  The deeper we travel into the ocean, the deeper we delve into our own psyche. And when we can go no further - there lurks the Kraken. </p><p>  Most likely the Kraken is based on a real creature - the giant squid. The huge mollusc takes pride of place as the personification of the terrors of the deep sea. Sailors would have encountered it at the surface, dying, and probably thrashing about. It would have made a weird sight, \"about the most alien thing you can imagine,\" says Edith Widder, CEO at the Ocean Research and Conservation Association. </p><p>  \"It has eight lashing arms and two slashing tentacles growing straight out of its head and it's got serrated suckers that can latch on to the slimiest of prey and it's got a parrot beak that can rip flesh. It's got an eye the size of your head, it's got a jet propulsion system and three hearts that pump blue blood.\"</p><p>  The giant squid continued to dominate stories of sea monsters with the famous 1870 novel, Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea, by Jules Verne. Verne's submarine fantasy is a classic story of puny man against a gigantic squid. </p><p>  The monster needed no embellishment - this creature was scary enough, and Verne incorporated as much fact as possible into the story, says Emily Alder from Edinburgh Napier University. \"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea and another contemporaneous book, Victor Hugo's Toilers of the Sea, both tried to represent the giant squid as they might have been actual zoological animals, much more taking the squid as a biological creature than a mythical creature.\" It was a given that the squid was vicious and would readily attack humans given the chance. </p><p>  That myth wasn't busted until 2012, when Edith Widder and her colleagues were the first people to successfully film giant squid under water and see first-hand the true character of the monster of the deep. They realised previous attempts to film squid had failed because the bright lights and noisy thrusters on submersibles had frightened them away. </p><p>  By quietening down the engines and using bioluminescence to attract it, they managed to see this most extraordinary animal in its natural habitat. It serenely glided into view, its body rippled with metallic colours of bronze and silver. Its huge, intelligent eye watched the submarine warily as it delicately picked at the bait with its beak. It was balletic and mesmeric. It could not have been further from the gnashing, human-destroying creature of myth and literature. In reality this is a gentle giant that is easily scared and pecks at its food.</p><p>  Another giant squid lies peacefully in the Natural History Museum in London, in the Spirit Room, where it is preserved in a huge glass case. In 2004 it was caught in a fishing net off the Falkland Islands and died at the surface. The crew immediately froze its body and it was sent to be preserved in the museum by the Curator of Molluscs, Jon Ablett. It is called Archie, an affectionate short version of its Latin name Architeuthis dux. It is the longest preserved specimen of a giant squid in the world.</p><p>  \"It really has brought science to life for many people,\" says Ablett. \"Sometimes I feel a bit overshadowed by Archie, most of my work is on slugs and snails but unfortunately most people don't want to talk about that!\"</p><p>  And so today we can watch Archie's graceful relative on film and stare Archie herself (she is a female) eye-to-eye in a museum. But have we finally slain the monster of the deep? Now we know there is nothing to be afraid of, can the Kraken finally be laid to rest? Probably not says Classen. \"We humans are afraid of the strangest things. They don't need to be realistic. There's no indication that enlightenment and scientific progress has banished the monsters from the shadows of our imaginations. We will continue to be afraid of very strange things, including probably sea monsters.\" </p><p>  Indeed we are. The Kraken made a fearsome appearance in the blockbuster series Pirates of the Caribbean. It forced Captain Jack Sparrow to face his demons in a terrifying face-to-face encounter. Pirates needed the monstrous Kraken, nothing else would do. Or, as the German film director Werner Herzog put it, \"What would an ocean be without a monster lurking in the dark? It would be like sleep without dreams.\"</p></div></div>"

So how did science fiction writer HG Wells predict its invention three decades before the first detonations?</strong></p><p><strong>(A)</strong> Imagine you're the greatest fantasy writer of your age. One day you dream up the idea of a bomb of infinite power. You call it the \"atomic bomb\". HG Wells first imagined a uranium-based hand grenade that \"would continue to explode indefinitely\" in his 1914 novel The World Set Free. He even thought it would be dropped from planes. What he couldn't predict was how a strange conjunction of his friends and acquaintances - notably Winston Churchill, who'd read all Wells's novels twice, and the physicist Leo Szilard - would turn the idea from fantasy to reality, leaving them deeply tormented by the scale of destructive power that it unleashed.</p><p><strong>(B)</strong> The story of the atom bomb starts in the Edwardian age, when scientists such as Ernest Rutherford were grappling with a new way of conceiving the physical world. The idea was that solid elements might be made up of tiny particles in atoms. \"When it became apparent that the Rutherford atom had a dense nucleus, there was a sense that it was like a coiled spring,\" says Andrew Nahum, curator of the Science Museum's Churchill's Scientists exhibition. Wells was fascinated with the new discoveries. He had a track record of predicting technological innovations. Winston Churchill credited Wells for coming up with the idea of using aeroplanes and tanks in combat ahead of World War One.</p><p><strong>(C)</strong> The two men met and discussed ideas over the decades, especially as Churchill, a highly popular writer himself, spent the interwar years out of political power, contemplating the rising instability of Europe. Churchill grasped the danger of technology running ahead of human maturity, penning a 1924 article in the Pall Mall Gazette called \"Shall we all commit suicide?\". In the article, Churchill wrote: \"Might a bomb no bigger than an orange be found to possess a secret power to destroy a whole block of buildings - nay to concentrate the force of a thousand tons of cordite and blast a township at a stroke?\" This idea of the orange-sized bomb is credited by Graham Farmelo, author of Churchill's Bomb, directly to the imagery of The World Set Free.</p><p><strong>(D)</strong> By 1932 British scientists had succeeded in splitting the atom for the first time by artificial means, although some believed it couldn't produce huge amounts of energy. But the same year the Hungarian emigre physicist Leo Szilard read The World Set Free. Szilard believed that the splitting of the atom could produce vast energy. He later wrote that Wells showed him \"what the liberation of atomic energy on a large scale would mean\". Szilard suddenly came up with the answer in September 1933 - the chain reaction - while watching the traffic lights turn green in Russell Square in London. He wrote: \"It suddenly occurred to me that if we could find an element which is split by neutrons and which would emit two neutrons when it absorbed one neutron, such an element, if assembled in sufficiently large mass, could sustain a nuclear chain reaction.\"</p><p><strong>(E)</strong> In that eureka moment, Szilard also felt great fear - of how a bustling city like London and all its inhabitants could be destroyed in an instant as he reflected in his memoir published in 1968: \"Knowing what it would mean - and I knew because I had read HG Wells - I did not want this patent to become public.\" The Nazis were on the rise and Szilard was deeply anxious about who else might be working on the chain reaction theory and an atomic Bomb. Wells's novel Things To Come, turned into a 1936 film, The Shape of Things to Come, accurately predicted aerial bombardment and an imminent devastating world war. In 1939 Szilard drafted the letter Albert Einstein sent to President Roosevelt warning America that Germany was stockpiling uranium. The Manhattan Project was born.</p><p><strong>(F)</strong> Szilard and several British scientists worked on it with the US military's massive financial backing. Britons and Americans worked alongside each other in \"silos\" - each team unaware of how their work fitted together. They ended up moving on from the original enriched uranium \"gun\" method, which had been conceived in Britain, to create a plutonium implosion weapon instead. Szilard campaigned for a demonstration bomb test in front of the Japanese ambassador to give them a chance to surrender. He was horrified that it was instead dropped on a city. In 1945 Churchill was beaten in the general election and in another shock, the US government passed the 1946 McMahon Act, shutting Britain out of access to the atomic technology it had helped create. William Penney, one of the returning Los Alamos physicists, led the team charged by Prime Minister Clement Atlee with somehow putting together their individual pieces of the puzzle to create a British bomb on a fraction of the American budget.</p><p><strong>(G)</strong> \"It was a huge intellectual feat,\" Andrew Nahum observes. \"Essentially they reworked the calculations that they'd been doing in Los Alamos. They had the services of Klaus Fuchs, who [later] turned out to be an atom spy passing information to the Soviet Union, but he also had a phenomenal memory.\" Another British physicist, Patrick Blackett, who discussed the Bomb after the war with a German scientist in captivity, observed that there were no real secrets. According to Nahum he said: \"It's a bit like making an omelette. Not everyone can make a good one.\" When Churchill was re-elected in 1951 he \"found an almost complete weapon ready to test and was puzzled and fascinated by how Atlee had buried the costs in the budget\", says Nahum. \"He was very conflicted about whether to go ahead with the test and wrote about whether we should have 'the art and not the article'. Meaning should it be enough to have the capability… [rather] than to have a dangerous weapon in the armoury.\"</p><p><strong>(H)</strong> Churchill was convinced to go ahead with the test, but the much more powerful hydrogen bomb developed three years later worried him greatly. HG Wells died in 1946. He had been working on a film sequel to The Shape of Things To Come that was to include his concerns about the now-realised atomic bomb he'd first imagined. But it was never made. Towards the end of his life, says Nahum, Wells's friendship with Churchill \"cooled a little\". \"Wells considered Churchill as an enlightened but tarnished member of the ruling classes.\" And Churchill had little time for Wells's increasingly fanciful socialist utopian ideas.</p><p><strong>(I)</strong> Wells believed technocrats and scientists would ultimately run a peaceful new world order like in The Shape of Things To Come, even if global war destroyed the world as we knew it first. Churchill, a former soldier, believed in the lessons of history and saw diplomacy as the only way to keep mankind from self-destruction in the atomic age. Wells's scientist acquaintance Leo Szilard stayed in America and campaigned for civilian control of atomic energy, equally pessimistic about Wells's idea of a bold new scientist-led world order. If anything Szilard was tormented by the power he had helped unleash. In 1950, he predicted a cobalt bomb that would destroy all life on the planet. In Britain, the legacy of the Bomb was a remarkable period of elite scientific innovation as the many scientists who had worked on weaponry or radar returned to their civilian labs. They gave us the first commercial jet airliner, the Comet, near-supersonic aircraft and rockets, highly engineered computers, and the Jodrell Bank giant moveable radio telescope.</p><p><strong>(J)</strong> The latter had nearly ended the career of its champion, physicist Bernard Lovell, with its huge costs, until the 1957 launch of Sputnik, when it emerged that Jodrell Bank had the only device in the West that could track it. Nahum says Lovell reflected that \"during the war the question was never what will something cost. The question was only can you do it and how soon can we have it? And that was the spirit he took into his peacetime science.\" Austerity and the tiny size of the British market, compared with America, were to scupper those dreams. But though the Bomb created a new terror, for a few years at least, Britain saw a vision of a benign atomic future, too and believed it could be the shape of things to come.</p></div></div>"

Speaking earlier, Culture Secretary John Whittingdale rejected suggestions that he wanted to dismantle the BBC.</p><p style=\"font-weight:bold;\">'Champion supporters'</p><p>Iannucci co-wrote <em>\"I'm Alan Partridge\"</em>, wrote the movie <em>\"In the Loop\"</em> and created and wrote the hit <em>\"HBO\"</em> and <em>\"Sky Atlantic show Veep\"</em>. He delivered the 40th annual MacTaggart Lecture, which has previously been given by Oscar winner Kevin Spacey, former BBC director general Greg Dyke, Jeremy Paxman and Rupert Murdoch. Iannucci said: \"Faced with a global audience, British television needs its champion supporters.\"</p><p>He continued his praise for British programming by saying the global success of American TV shows had come about because they were emulating British television. \"The best US shows are modelling themselves on what used to make British TV so world-beating,\" he said. \"US prime-time schedules are now littered with those quirky formats from the UK - the <em>\"Who Do You Think You Are\"</em>'s and the variants on <em>\"Strictly Come Dancing\"</em> - as well as the single-camera non-audience sitcom, which we brought into the mainstream first. We have changed international viewing for the better.\"</p><p>With the renewal of the BBC's royal charter approaching, Iannucci also praised the corporation. He said: \"If public service broadcasting - one of the best things we've ever done creatively as a country - if it was a car industry, our ministers would be out championing it overseas, trying to win contracts, boasting of the British jobs that would bring.\" In July, the government issued a green paper setting out issues that will be explored during negotiations over the future of the BBC, including the broadcaster's size, its funding and governance.</p><p>Primarily Mr Whittingdale wanted to appoint a panel of five people, but finally he invited two more people to advise on the channer renewal, namely former Channel 4 boss Dawn Airey and journalism professor Stewart Purvis, a former editor-in-chief of ITN. Iannucci bemoaned the lack of \"creatives\" involved in the discussions. </p><p>\"When the media, communications and information industries make up nearly 8% our GDP, larger than the car and oil and gas industries put together, we need to be heard, as those industries are heard. But when I see the panel of experts who've been asked by the culture secretary to take a root and branch look at the BBC, I don't see anyone who is a part of that cast and crew list. I see executives, media owners, industry gurus, all talented people - but not a single person who's made a classic and enduring television show.\"</p><p style=\"font-weight:bold;\">'Don't be modest'</p><p>Iannucci suggested one way of easing the strain on the licence fee was \"by pushing ourselves more commercially abroad\". </p><p>\"Use the BBC's name, one of the most recognised brands in the world,\" he said. \"And use the reputation of British television across all networks, to capitalise financially oversees. Be more aggressive in selling our shows, through advertising, through proper international subscription channels, freeing up BBC Worldwide to be fully commercial, whatever it takes.</p><p>\"Frankly, don't be icky and modest about making money, let's monetise the bezeesus Mary and Joseph out of our programmes abroad so that money can come back, take some pressure off the licence fee at home and be invested in even more ambitious quality shows, that can only add to our value.\"</p><p>Mr Whittingdale, who was interviewed by ITV News' Alastair Stewart at the festival, said he wanted an open debate about whether the corporation should do everything it has done in the past. He said he had a slight sense that people who rushed to defend the BBC were \"trying to have an argument that's never been started\".</p><p>\"Whatever my view is, I don't determine what programmes the BBC should show,\" he added. \"That's the job of the BBC.\" Mr Whittingdale said any speculation that the Conservative Party had always wanted to change the BBC due to issues such as its editorial line was \"absolute nonsense\".</p></div>"
